notes: In June 2015, the Province of Ontario launched a review of the City of Toronto
  Act, 2006 (COTA), as required by legislation. As part of the review, the Province
  sought input from municipalities, organizations, and residents. To help make sure
  the Province heard from Torontonians during this review, the City of Toronto conducted
  a public consultation between October 21 and November 6, 2015 including a public
  meeting and an online survey. The purpose of posting this data set is to create
  a record of the consultation and the public's input.
