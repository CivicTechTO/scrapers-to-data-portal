notes: The 'Structures' dataset shows the bridge locations as points in a shape file
  and records in a excel file. Each record in the datasets has the structure ID, Type
  and Class. Each record also has the location description, ownership and year of
  construction for the structure. With each record there are 2 sets of coordinates
  identifying the location in WGS'84 (lat.&long.) and NAD'27 datum, 1974 adjustment
  and projected in 3 degree MTM.
